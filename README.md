# Fingerprinting of Malware Families Under Uncertainty

Identification of attacks on IT infrastructure is the havoc created by malware. The majority of the malware attacks are performed by set of malware, which are variants of one another. It becomes critical to identify malware and its variants from their behavior, captured in the trace data. In this work, a two-step methodology is created and evaluated to group, malware and variants based on  similar behavior. The data from the traces are incomplete and imprecise. In the first step, methods inspired by biological sequence analysis, traces are represented by discrete-time Markov chains.   Kullback-Leibler divergence and Jensen-Shannon divergence are computed as a similarity metric between pairwise comparison of discrete-time Markov chains. An edge-labeled graph on traces and similarities is constructed.  The second step consists of application of minimum spanning tree and community detection algorithms on the edge-labeled graph for construction of similar malware traces. The features are constructed from communities of malware and its variants, were used in the machine learning models for automated detection for malware for classification. Experiments were conducted for the validation of the method and the results are presented.
